In this section we'll give a brief but detailed look on how our weeks were managed in terms of development and decision making

## Week 1 (12 Feb -> 19 Feb)
### Brief Overview
We met with our mentor, professor Susana Sargento in person joined by our Bosch collaborators via Skype where we made some decisions about
the project.

As a result of this meeting we had most of the information to start the first stage of the project which is choosing the hardware.
Some architectural decisions were also made to help us build a first draft of what can become our system's architecture.
