As a result of this meeting we had most of the information to start the first stage of the project which is choosing the hardware. Some architectural decisions were also made to help us build a first draft of what can become our system's architecture.","title":"Logbook"},{"location":"logbook/#week-1-12-feb-19-feb","text":"","title":"Week 1 (12 Feb -&gt; 19 Feb)"},{"location":"logbook/#brief-overview","text":"We met with our mentor, professor Susana Sargento in person joined by our Bosch collaborators via Skype where we made some decisions about the project.
